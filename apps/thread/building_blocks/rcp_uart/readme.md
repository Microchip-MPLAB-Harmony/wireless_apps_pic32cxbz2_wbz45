# Thread Radio Co-Processor

[Getting Started with Thread](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C)

## Introduction
The Thread RCP example demonstrates an Thread application that can serve as Radio Co-Processor over UART.

## Programming the precompiled hex file or Application Example

**Programming the hex file using MPLABX IPE**

1.  Precompiled Hex file is located in "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\rcp\_uart\\hex".

2.  Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://microchipdeveloper.com/ipe:programming-device)


**Caution:** Users should choose the correct Device and Tool information

**Programming the Application using MPLABX IDE**

1.  Follow steps mentioned in of [Running a Precompiled Example](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C-en-US-2/index.html?GUID-EA74172C-595E-4A34-B359-D42EE443F0EC) document

2.  Open and program the Application Example "rcp\_uart.x" located in "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\rcp\_uart\\firmware" using MPLABX IDE.

## Developing this Application from scratch using MPLAB Code Configurator

Create a new MCC Harmony Project --[link](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-2DB248AF-C243-496D-9819-969E43CA63BC) follow the steps in the Topic "6.6 MCC Project creation for RCP with Thread Component" to create new project using MCC.

## Running the project

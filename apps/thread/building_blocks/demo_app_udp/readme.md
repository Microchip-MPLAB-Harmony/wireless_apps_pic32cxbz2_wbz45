# Thread UDP Demo Application

[Getting Started with Thread](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C)

## Introduction
The Standalone Thread UDP Demo Application example demonstrates bidirectional communication using UDP APIâ€™s on Thread.

The application supports the following device types, FTD as router,FTD as leader,MTD as MED, MTD as SED.

## Programming the precompiled hex file or Application Example

**Programming the hex file using MPLABX IPE**

1.  Precompiled Hex file is located in "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\demo\_app\_udp\\demo\_app\_udp\_ftd\\hex" and "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\demo\_app\_udp\\demo\_app\_udp\_mtd\\hex" for FTD and MTD respectively.

2.  Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://microchipdeveloper.com/ipe:programming-device)


**Caution:** Users should choose the correct Device and Tool information

**Programming the Application using MPLABX IDE**

1.  Follow steps mentioned in of [Running a Precompiled Example](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-A5330D3A-9F51-4A26-B71D-8503A493DF9C-en-US-2/index.html?GUID-EA74172C-595E-4A34-B359-D42EE443F0EC) document

2.  Open and program the Application Example "demo\_app\_udp\_ftd.x" located in "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\demo\_app\_udp\\demo\_app\_udp\_ftd\\firmware" and "demo\_app\_udp\_mtd.x" located in "<Harmony Content Path\>/wireless\_apps\_pic32cxbz2\_wbz45\\apps\\thread\\building\_blocks\\demo\_app\_udp\\demo\_app\_udp\_mtd\\firmware" using MPLABX IDE for FTD and MTD respectively.

## Developing this Application from scratch using MPLAB Code Configurator

Create a new MCC Harmony Project --[link](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-2DB248AF-C243-496D-9819-969E43CA63BC) follow the steps in Topic "7.2 Creating Demo UDP Thread Application" to create new project using MCC.

## Building and Testing the project

For Application Description follow the steps in Topic "7.3 UDP Application Description" -- [link](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-2DB248AF-C243-496D-9819-969E43CA63BC)

For running the project follow the steps in Topic "7.4 Running the UDP Demo Application" -- [link](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-2DB248AF-C243-496D-9819-969E43CA63BC).

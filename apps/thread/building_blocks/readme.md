# Building Block Examples

This section covers PIC32CX\_BZ2\_WBZ45x Application Building Blocks. Building blocks are compact training modules revolving around implementing a particular Thread functionality/feature on PIC32CXBZ2 and WBZ451 Devices.

These training modules ease users' development experience by providing a step-by-step procedure to build a Thread Feature from Scratch. Moving through the building blocks, users will be able to gain familiarity with the SDK, MPLAB Harmony software development framework, MPLAB Code Configurator, and API's necessary for implementing the Thread features of interest. Users who have working knowledge of Thread and no familiarity with the Harmony framework, Microchip Thread SDK, tools, etc., are recommended to start their SW development process with Building Blocks.

New MPLAB Code Configurator users are recommended to go through the **[overview](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-B5D058F5-1D0B-4720-8649-ACE5C0EEE2C0)**.

There are three categories of Application Examples that familiarize users with the use of the Thread stack and assist in creating basic Thread UDP applications from scratch.

1.  **[CLI](cli/readme.md)**

2.  **[UDP Demo Application](demo_app_udp/readme.md)**

3.  **[Radio Co-Processor](rcp_uart/readme.md)**

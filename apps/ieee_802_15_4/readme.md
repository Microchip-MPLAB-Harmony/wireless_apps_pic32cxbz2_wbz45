# IEEE 802.15.4 Standalone PHY based P2P PHY Application

Documentation describing steps to test and develop the precompiled IEEE 802.15.4 P2P PHY Application examples

-P2P PHY Application is built on top of the Standalone IEEE 802.15.4 Physical Layer for PIC32CX-BZ2 platform devices.
-The application demonstrates the usage of Standalone 15.4 PHY Component, which provides interface to access the 802.15.4(zigbee) subsystem of PIC32CX-BZ2 devices through which user can enables
various functionaities of the transceiver.
-The application supports various functionaities - Chat Mode, Throughput Test Mode, Continuous Test Mode, Periodic Test Mode, PER Test Mode.
User can switch between different modes via CLI commands. Refer to the following docs for more details.

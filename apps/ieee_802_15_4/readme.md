# PHY and MAC Applications

Documentation describing steps to test and develop the precompiled PHY and MAC application examples.

The ieee 802.15.4 Application examples are divided into PHY and MAC application examples.

1.  PHY - The application demonstrates the usage of Standalone 15.4 PHY Component, which provides interface to access the 802.15.4(zigbee) subsystem of PIC32CX-BZ2 devices through which user can enables various functionaities of the transceiver.

2.  MAC - This application showcases the utilization of the Standalone 802.15.4-MAC Component, which offers an interface for accessing the 802.15.4 MAC layer. This allows users to leverage the various functionalities available within the MAC layer.

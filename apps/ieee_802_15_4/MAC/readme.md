# MAC Applications
Documentation describing steps to develop and test 802.15.4 MAC Application examples

- MAC Applications are built on top of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 Physical Layer for PIC32CX-BZ2 platform devices.
- The application demonstrates the usage of Standalone 802.15.4-MAC Component to form a 4-node star configuration, which comprises of a Coordinator (FFD) and 4 End Devices (RFDs). The End Devices pull data from the Coordinator through polling, while also transmitting data back to the Coordinator.
- This application serves as an example of the bidirectional capabilities of MAC. Refer to the following docs for more details.

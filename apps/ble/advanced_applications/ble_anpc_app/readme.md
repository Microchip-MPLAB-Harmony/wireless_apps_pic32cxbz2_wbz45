| Description                                | Variable              | Value      | 
| ----------------------------------         | ---------------       | ---------- | 
| The timeout for advertisement without bond | timeout_adv           | 60 seconds | 
| The timeout for advertisement with bond    | timeout_with_bond_adv | 30 seconds | 


This application demonstrates how to simulate an ANPC device on the curiosity board which is **Device** in the state machine. There are the following states and their introductions behind in the state machine:

State machine:
- **APP_ANPC_STATE_IDLE**:          The application remains in idle mode.
- **APP_ANPC_STATE_ADV**:           The application is waiting for a new connection within timeout_adv seconds.
- **APP_ANPC_STATE_WITH_BOND_ADV**: The application is waiting for a reconnection within timeout_with_bond_adv seconds.
- **APP_ANPC_STATE_CONN**:          The application is prepared to send commands/receive notifications.

This application relies on Button 1 as the input and LEDs/UART as the output to have interactions with users. MPLABÂ® X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides a UART tool which is in Tools/Embedded/Simple Serial Port Terminal.

### 2.2 Testing
#### 2.2.1 Environment Setup
- In the following section, ANPS device and ANPS device 2 represent WBZ series curiosity board with Alert Notification server role application (ble_anps_app).
- In the following section, ANPC device represents WBZ series curiosity board with Alert Notification client role application (ble_anpc_app).

The WBZ series ANPC device is connected via Uart tool to the computer using the USB cable.
#### 2.2.2 Test Introduction
There are tests which are described below, please do them in order.

**Test 1**: Basically, the idea is to demonstrate:
- How to establish a connection and pair with the curiosity board.
- How to receive notifications and perform actions after establishing a connection.
- How to reconnect to the curiosity board after disconnecting.

**Test 2**: Basically, the idea is to demonstrate:
- How to allow a new device to be bonded with the curiosity board.

The LEDs behavior according to the "APP Connection State."

**Test 2**:

17. On the ANPS device, unplug the USB cable to turn off the power.
18. On the computer, compile and program the ANPS application to the ANPS device 2.
    - On the ANPS device 2, plug in the USB cable to power on and establish a new connection with the ANPC device.
19. On the ANPC device, it enters the APP_ANPC_STATE_WITH_BOND_ADV state, it is waiting for reconnection with the ANPS device, thus it will not attempt to reconnect with the ANPS device 2.
20. On the ANPC device, long press Button 1 to enter the APP_ANPC_STATE_ADV state and wait for a new connection within timeout_adv seconds.
21. On the ANPC device, it enters the APP_ANPC_STATE_CONN state, indicating that a connection has been established with ANPS device 2.

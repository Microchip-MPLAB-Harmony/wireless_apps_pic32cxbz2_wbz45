## Demo Description

This application demonstrate the Zigbee On/Off light joining to Zigbee gateway (Combined Interface) and the Microchip 
Proprietary Transparent Service based BLE peripheral running concurrently with zigbee protocol connects with mobile app. 
When the Zigbee light gets the light on/off command from CI will be displayed in mobile app. 
Hence the simple concurrent operation of multiprotocol is demonstrated here. Lights and Bridge (CI) devices are the 
interest of this tutorial, where the WIFI/Ethernet gateway is not scope of this application. The thirdparty gateway's 
like Amazon Echo plus can also be used instead of CI.

# BLE+MAC Combo Application

Documentation describing steps to develop and test BLE+MAC Combo Application examples

- This demonstration application illustrates the deployment of provisioning through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to configure MAC commissioning parameters on the WBZ451 Curiosity Development Board, which is integrated with the PIC32CX-BZ2 module. Additionally, it exhibits the two-way communication between the mobile application and the Full Function Device (FFD). Upon completion of the provisioning process, the RFD device transmits random temperature data to the FFD device and it then forward the received data to the connected mobile app. Furthermore, the mobile application enables users to remotely control the LED on the FFD device.Refer to the following docs for more details.
